IRC Mod API
-----------
This file documents the API exported by the IRC mod.


BASICS
------
In order to allow your mod to interface with this mod, you must add `irc'
 (without the quotes) to your mod's `depends.txt' file.


REFERENCE
---------
These are the functions defined by the mod:

mt_irc.say ( [name ,] message )
  Sends <message> to either the channel (if <name> is nil or not specified),
   or to the given user (if <name> is specified).
  Example:
    mt_irc.say("Hello, Channel!")
    mt_irc.say("john1234", "How are you?")

mt_irc.register_bot_command ( name, cmddef )
  Registers a new bot command named <name>.
  When an user sends a private message to the bot starting with `!name', the
   command's function is called.
  Here's the command definition (<cmddef>):
    cmddef = {
      params = "<param1> ...",      -- A short help text for !help
      description = "My command",   -- What does the command? (one-liner)
      func = function ( from, param )
        -- This function gets called when the command is invoked.
        -- <from> is the name of the user that invoked the command.
        -- <param> is the rest of the input (after removing !command)
      end,
    };
  Example:
    mt_irc.register_bot_command("hello", {
      params = nil, -- No params
      description = "Greet user",
      func = function ( from, param )
        mt_irc.say(from, "Hello!");
      end,
    });
