Version 0.1.1:
    - Moved all user configuration to `config.lua'.
    - Added formatted messages for sent and received messages and options
       to change them.
    - Added options to change port, password.
    - Added support for sending/receiving private messages.
    - Removed need for separate packmod.{sh|bat} scripts. Now everything
       is (almost) nicely handled by CMake.
    - Now all sources (including Lua itself) are added to a single
       luasocket lib. This will hopefully fix some cases where the linker
       b0rk3d with undefined references under Linux.
    - Added option to enable/disable connecting when starting the game, and
       the /irc_connect chat command to connect manually to the server (as
       suggested by OldCoder). The /irc_connect chat command requires the
       `irc_admin' privilege.
    - Added option to enable/disable joining the channel when a player joins,
       and the /join and /part chat commands to join and part the channel
       manually if desired (as suggested by OldCoder).

Version 0.1.0:
    - At least it's working :)
