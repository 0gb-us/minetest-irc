IRC Mod for Minetest
(C) 2012 Diego Mart√≠nez <kaeza@users.sf.net>

INTRODUCTION
------------
This mod is just a glue between luasocket, LuaIRC, and Minetest. It
 provides a two-way communication between the in-game chat, and an
 arbitrary IRC channel. 

Note: This mod is currently a work-in-progress, and is only tested under
       Ubuntu 12.04 with Minetest 0.4.3 and 0.4.4-dev. Testers for other
       platforms are welcome.


INSTALLING
----------
Unpack the archive and put the `irc' directory in any of the directories
 where Minetest looks for mods. For more information, see:
    http://wiki.minetest.net/wiki/Installing_mods


SETTINGS
--------
All settings are changed directly in the script. If any of these settings
 are either nil or false, the default value is used.

    SERVER (string, default "irc.freenode.net")
        This is the IRC server the mod connects to.

    CHANNEL (string, default "#minetest-irc-testing")
        The IRC channel to join.

    DTIME (number, default 0.2)
        This is the time in seconds between updates in the connection.
        In order not to block the game, the mod must periodically "poll"
        the connection to both send messages to, and receive messages
        from the channel. A high value means slower connection to IRC,
        but possibly better response from the game. A low value means
        the mod "polls" the connection more often, but can make the
        game hang. It allows fractional values.
